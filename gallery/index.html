    <h1> Fluidity of Air and Sea </h1>
    <h4>by Aoife Hernon</h4>
    <img src="IMG_5518.jpg" width="500" />
    <p>I created a suspended hot air balloon lamp. It is made from 1/8” plywood, and held together with only wooden joints and precise kerfs. The detailed interior wooden frame is designed to reflect a pattern on the ground and ceiling, while the mulberry paper covering around the middle softens the light and provides a comforting glow. This piece is intended to emulate a sense of childhood whimsy as the hot air balloon and basket are suspended and glowing from the ceiling. The paper covering is painted with a 3D printed block print pattern. This pattern has taken inspiration from seaweed and schools of fish and aims to draw the eye around the body of the balloon and capture the audience in deep-sea suspension.</p>

    <h1> Foggy Dew </h1>
    <h4>by Aoife Hernon </h4>
    <img src="StoneCircle.JPG" width="500" />
    <p>Inspired by the stone circle 10 minutes from where I grew up, I experimented with layers of watercolor, white gouache, and etching to portray the mystical feel of this ancient ruin. </p>

    <h1> Feadóg </h1>
    <h4>by Aoife Hernon</h4>
    <img src="tinwhistle.jpg" width="500" />
    <p>I created an etching on a black etching board of old hands playing the tin whistle. This is reminiscent of the Irish "Feadog" that children have been learning for generations, and often feels etched into my memory and heritage. </p>

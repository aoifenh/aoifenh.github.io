       Aoife Hernon is originally from Ireland but moved to the Bay Area with her family 10 years ago. She is a fourth year student at UCSB majoring in Sociology, and double minoring in Applied Psychology and Media Arts and Design. She is also a member of the Track and Field team at UCSB, but when she is not running she enjoys painting, cooking, reading, and anything outdoors.

       Aoife Hernon is originally from Ireland but moved to the Bay Area with her family 10 years ago. She is a fourth year student at UCSB majoring in Sociology, and double minoring in Applied Psychology and Media Arts and Design. She is also a member of the Track and Field team at UCSB, but when she is not running she enjoys painting, cooking, reading, and anything outdoors. In addition to taking this course for minor credit, Aoife aims to better her praxis of design and commit creativity and practicality to physical creations in her future projects.
